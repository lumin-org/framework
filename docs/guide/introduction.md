# Introduction

Lumin Framework is a framework for Luau games, and is inspired by Knit and Flamework.

## Why use Framework?

- Minimal and light
- Generic
- Just works
- Strictly-typed
- Extendable

Framework is all of these and more. It is designed to avoid the common pitfalls of other frameworks, and to provide a solid foundation for your game with zero lock in or boilerplate.

If you're a `roblox-ts` user, Flamework is another solid choice. It is a bit more opinionated than ours, but it is also more feature-rich.
